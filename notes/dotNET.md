# DAY 1




### FullStack development 
  - front end + middle layer + data layer
    Web site + web services + database management

### online shopping application using .NET
 -  Database:   
     - MySQL + local database (local sql server) 
 - Business logic :
    - Product catalog logic
    - Shopping cart 
    - order proccesing
    - Payment and billing 
    - Authentication and Authorization 
    - shipment (Delivery)
- Service layer:
    - Product Catalog service
    - Shopping cart service
    - order proccesing service
    - Payment process and billing  service
    - Authentication service 
    - Authorization service
    - shipment (Delivery) service

**light weight , business logic accessed by via HTTP request REST ful web services**

- Web Site:
    - web user interface + online web application management
    - web pages + validation  + state management, web security, caching, personalization, multilingual web, etc..
    - Responsive UI

### Baby step Learning:
- Hello world using Visual Studio.NET
- learn basics of C# Progtamming
- Learn Visual studio .NET Application Development Process

### Rules to create project
- Launch VS IDE
- create .NET Framework Console Application
- Start working with Project by modifying or adding C# code 
 

### Console Class
- Two static major fucntion 
    - WriteLine,ReadLine
```cs
Console.ReadLine("hello world");
Console.WriteLine();
```

- Everything in C# is defined within  namespace 
- Each class should be defined in namepsace.
- Class can have static and nonstatic methods.
- Entrypoint function main is alawys methods.
- Command Arguments are always access througth strign[] args.
- public,private,protected and internal aree acccess specifiers in C#.
- Class can have overloaded ctor.
- class expose private data members to outside using member functionss as well as through properties.
- Properties always encapuslate private data members of instance.
- Properties can readonly or writeonly  as well.
-  It is good practice to wirte new class in seperate file.
- this keyword in C# represent self refrence of an instance.
- value is inbuilt keyword in C#

# Day 3

>Agenda
1. C# Language Features
2. .NET Framework
3. Assembly


### Official Documentation
- Microsoft official .NET Documentation

### No.Stackoverflow--------> this site give lot of readymade problem
- solving samples
	

### C# Language Features

**Language syntax**
- Basic syntax of C# is similar like C++
- New Keywords in C#
- New Approach while developing Solution
-    Loosely Coupled, highly Cohesive 
- Common Type  System (CTS)


### Value Types:
	primitive types ( inbuilt types)
				int, float, double, ....
				enumeration
				structure
				values are stored on stack


### Reference Types:
	- class:
        - concrete class
        - abstract class
	- interface:
        - IPrintable
        - ISacnnable
				Delegte:
				Event:
				
   - they are always stored on heap
   - Heap  is used for dynamic memory allocation for objects in .NET
   - Heap is managed by Garbage collector
   - Garbade collector takes care Automatic Memory Management.â€©

# Day 5
### Agenda:
- Design Pattern
- Singleton
- Observer : Event Driven Application				
- C#  reference types:
    - Delegate
    - Events			
- Windows based App Development
- ClassFactory
- C# Programming
- Syntax : 
    - like C++, like Java, like VB
    - Language Interoperability(Cross Language Programming)
    - we can also pointers  *ptr
    - acces native code from C# using keyword unsafe
    - simplified syntax with new kewords
    ```cs
    as  is  ref out  params
    sealed value interface;
    abstract virtual override
    region new foreach using
    get set  const readonly static 
    this base
	```
	- Grammers:
		- Rules, constructs
	    - Common Type System
	
	- Value Types:
        - inbuilt (primitive) types,
        - Enum, struct
	- Reference Types:
        - class, interface
        - delegate, event

	- **Object Orientation:**
        - Abstraction,
        - Encapsulation,
        - Inheritance (Polymorphism),
        - Typing, Concurrency, Modularity, Persistence, Hierachy
			 
	> Reusable types: Framework Class Library ( FCL)
    - a set of classes,
    - a set of interfaces,
    - a set of structures,
    - a set of enumeration,
    - a set of attributes

	## Adopts Design Patterns

	  : using C# language we can apply design patterns while building apps.

	>What do you means Design Pattern ?

	- Pattern:
		- Design pattern are solution to software  design problems  you find again and again in real world app developement.
		- Patterns are about resualbe designs and interaction object.
			
		- There are almost  23 Gang of Four  pattersn  are consisered  as Design Patters.

	> Categories:

	- Creational
		- singleton, class factory,etc.
	- Structural 
		- MVC, MVP,MVVM etc.
	- Behavioural
		- Observer,etc.


    - Vehicle:
		- Engine:
            - EME  subject 
            - two stroke-------Yamaha, Rajdoot, Yezdi, java, Bajaj M80
            - four stroke -----Splendor, pulsar, etc.
            - multi cyclinder engine------ Heavy Vehicles

	- Software:	
        - millions of softwares been developed in these 60  years.
        - Insurance
        - Telecom
        - Finance
        - Research & Development
        - Production

		 >Few Computer engg. discrovered common patterns applied in those solutions.
		 They named it as Design Patterns

---
## Design Patterns
				  

>Can  you write code using standard structure to solve common problem
				
- MVC           ( Model---- View------ Controller)
- Singleton     ( only instacne of class will  be created)
- Class Factory ( )
.etc.


- Music:	
    - Swar: ( syntax)
         - Sa , Re, Ga............  

- Classical Music: ( design patterns)
    - Ragas ( Patterns)
       -  composition of swar


- Bolloywood Song: ( building Softwares)
    - has been composed my Musical Director
      -   taal  + laay + Sur   =Melody

## Event Drive Mechanism

- Event Delagation Model
- events: underbalance, overbalance
- delegations: HDFCBank, Goverment
	
- First Observer : 
    - Account object ( to be observed  is balance)
- Events:	
   - underbalance, overbalance  ( notify to external subscribers)
- Subscribers:	
   - HDFC Bank , Government    ( respond to events occured against notification received )
