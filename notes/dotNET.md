# DAY 1




### FullStack development 
  - front end + middle layer + data layer
    Web site + web services + database management

### online shopping application using .NET
 -  Database:   
     - MySQL + local database (local sql server) 
 - Business logic :
    - Product catalog logic
    - Shopping cart 
    - order proccesing
    - Payment and billing 
    - Authentication and Authorization 
    - shipment (Delivery)
- Service layer:
    - Product Catalog service
    - Shopping cart service
    - order proccesing service
    - Payment process and billing  service
    - Authentication service 
    - Authorization service
    - shipment (Delivery) service

**light weight , business logic accessed by via HTTP request REST ful web services**

- Web Site:
    - web user interface + online web application management
    - web pages + validation  + state management, web security, caching, personalization, multilingual web, etc..
    - Responsive UI

### Baby step Learning:
- Hello world using Visual Studio.NET
- learn basics of C# Progtamming
- Learn Visual studio .NET Application Development Process

### Rules to create project
- Launch VS IDE
- create .NET Framework Console Application
- Start working with Project by modifying or adding C# code 
 

### Console Class
- Two static major fucntion 
    - WriteLine,ReadLine
```cs
Console.ReadLine("hello world");
Console.WriteLine();
```

- Everything in C# is defined within  namespace 
- Each class should be defined in namepsace.
- Class can have static and nonstatic methods.
- Entrypoint function main is alawys methods.
- Command Arguments are always access througth strign[] args.
- public,private,protected and internal aree acccess specifiers in C#.
- Class can have overloaded ctor.
- class expose private data members to outside using member functionss as well as through properties.
- Properties always encapuslate private data members of instance.
- Properties can readonly or writeonly  as well.
-  It is good practice to wirte new class in seperate file.
- this keyword in C# represent self refrence of an instance.
- value is inbuilt keyword in C#



# Day 3

	1.C# Language Features
	2..NET Framework
	3.Assembly


### Official Documentation
		Microsoft official .NET Documentation

### No.Stackoverflow--------> this site give lot of readymade problem
			       solving samples
	

### C# Language Features

	  Language syntax
		Basic syntax of C# is similar like C++
		New Keywords in C#
		New Approach while developing Solution
			Loosely Coupled, highly Cohesive 
				


		Common Type  System (CTS)


- Value Types:
				primitive types ( inbuilt types)
				int, float, double, ....
				enumeration
				structure
				values are stored on stack


- Reference Types:
	- class:
        - concrete class
        - abstract class
	- interface:
        - IPrintable
        - ISacnnable
				Delegte:
				Event:
				
   - they are always stored on heap
   - Heap  is used for dynamic memory allocation for objects in .NET
   - Heap is managed by Garbage collector
   - Garbade collector takes care Automatic Memory Management.â€©
